<p>Myron W. Krueger is a pioneer in the field of computing, virtual reality, interaction, and beyond. Although he earned his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and a Masters and PhD in Computer Science, what has made him stand out in the field, and expand into other areas, is his passion for creative artistry and freedom of thought. His creations and vision are what brought him to the light of the big stage and to major exhibitions such as Ars Electronica. Because of these and his personality it is common to call him a computer artist rather than a computer scientist or programmer, and the end results are called creations rather than programs or machines.</p>

<p>He started working with various artists as early as 1969. He had understood through his years of working with artists that an artist and his tools have a close and good relationship. In those years when he had to teach artists how to use the computer he became more interested in communicating the meaning of a computer and showing them how to experience and express themselves with it rather than following the conventional way of using and teaching them. During his years teaching artists and as a university professor, he wanted to emphasize how we need to change not only how we teach and learn, but also what, to approach visions similar to his.</p> </p>

<p>His first known creation was made that year and was GLOWFLOW in which a piece of flooring with various pliers was used to activate people's footsteps, lighted tubes and play various synthesizer sounds. Although his first project wasn't considered anything special, it was the one that made him understand basic things and build his vision moving forward to the next ones.</p>

<p>His vision was the art of interaction, not art that happens to be interactive. He aspired to a general medium with clear cultural significance with application across a wide range. He wanted to break away from classical modes of interaction and create something new with a distinct structure. He was resentful of the fact that interaction requires the use of a device that has been around for centuries, such as a keyboard and mouse, and that in order to communicate with him he has to be seated in a chair across from him. The computer's refusal to treat him as a human with his familiar body (but as something similar to the one Tom Igoe designed) led him down the path of creating ways of interacting (both hardware and software) that would allow the computer to see him and treat him as a human ion.</p>

<p>Krueger wanted to avoid the use of devices such as gloves, VR goggles, suits, etc. as Jaron Lanier seems to have done. Instead he wanted to take a much freer approach that let people interact with the computer with their whole body. Beyond that, as he emphasized artwork and his work was human-centered he wanted to let the user feel free and make them flourish artistically by creating. Over the next few years he moved on to new creations such as METAPLAY a system that artists can create collaboratively with others, projecting images through the computer, and PSYCHIC SPACE.</p>

	<figcaption>Figure 2: Myron Krueger's research system Videoplace places the user's silhouette within a participatory interactive environment, where there is no distinction between users and graphics, using a real-time camera and without the intervention of an indirect interaction device. In contrast to the first virtual reality systems of that period, this system is described by its creator as an artificial reality, originally implemented with analogue filters and cinematic techniques before moving on to computer vision technologies.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Krueger's most important and well-known creation, however, is VIDEOPLACE, which is considered the first system to use the entire human body as a means of interaction. It is an embodiment of "computer art" and its implementation began in 1974 and continued to be aesthetically improved later. In this system, objects have distinct reactions to the user's movements and seem to have life like "CITTER", the system's graphic mascot. In this approach the importance of now and immediate interaction is important, the aim is not to save and then but to create as everything is done in real time.  It aspires to make people interact with each other in ways that are impossible to exist in the real world. The distinct structure of this system may perhaps faintly remind us of the sketchpad and give a unique perspective on the world of computing.</p> </p>

<p>VIDEOPLACE has been a great success especially in the art world and has appeared at several popular festivals and conferences such as Japan's SIGGRAPH and the great Ars Electronica where it was awarded first prize in 1990. Krueger even believes that this work can be beneficial in the field of psychology and psychotherapy as well as medically for the treatment of autism. Something similar to this 'old' and groundbreaking success seems to have been attempted to bring back to the surface by the playstation2 eye toy game/system in 2003 and the Kinect however with a more linear approach. Through his 1983 series of books published in 1983 titled "Artificial Reality" he provides a basis and analysis of the structure and features that such systems must carry in order to offer pure freedom to users.</p>

<p>What Krueger was aiming for through his creations is a new way of interaction without limitations. His close connection with the art world and people brought him closer to what they were thinking and allowed him to remain open-minded and visionary by having a separate outlook from the stereotypes that still seem to dominate both hardware and software today. His creations invite us to look at things more creatively using systems that truly leave us free and give us immediacy, without any limitations in standards. Still, he exemplifies how computing can support many fields, the importance of diversity and interdisciplinarity in the field, and the importance of understanding human nature.</p>
