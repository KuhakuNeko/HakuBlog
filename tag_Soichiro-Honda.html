<p>The Honda Civic is one of the most famous car models in the automotive history. You probably know someone who owns a Civic or you are a proud owner of one yourself. Its Japanese origin, durability, speed, comfort, driving behavior and the special technologies applied by Honda with their signature on this creation are the features that make it different from the rest. Even until today Honda Civic is considered one of the fastest front wheel drive cars. Through a series of blog entries, we will analyze the key pieces of Honda’s and Civic’s history as well as its distinctive features. Beyond that in the future there may be a tribute to the great Soichiro Honda.</p>

	<figcaption>Figure 1: The first generation Honda Civic is an automobile that was produced by Honda in Japan from July 1972 until 1979. It was their first genuine market success. Their Japanese reliability, love for cars, and thanks to technologies thought out and brought to life by them years ahead of the rest, made them shine in the automotive industry.</figcaption>

<p>Until then, let's make an introduction to what is to come. It all started with the failure of the small Honda N 500 in the American market in 1968. Americans are known to love bigger cars that can fit them easily and have a lot of trunk space. Soichiro Honda has decided by then that they should move on to a faster, better and stronger vehicle that will appeal to the American market. Soichiro Honda really wanted to make this car stand out and that lead to his engineers at Honda come to a disagreement with him in request like independent suspension which was something quite rare in the cars of the past. Of course nothing could stop the vision of Soichiro himself and in the end they just committed. He was targeting an easy to drive car with plenty of space. That’s why independent suspension in all four corners was a must as well as mounting the engine sideways to gain better weight distribution. The Honda’s commercial moto back then explained the concept pretty well “We make it simple.”. They were making an engaging daily driver with great drivability. But that was as far as the features went for the first Civic.</p>

<p>In 1973 Honda released the Civic in the American market. Civic actually did better and offered a really smooth driving on the city streets but the Civic hype wasn’t really there while American companies like Ford had their own offerings for the American people. What happened was that in the next year it was announced that unleaded gas will be available to every gas station. What this means is that catalytic converters now had to be added to the cars as lead additives would not affect them anymore. Of course no car company would like these since they would have to add catalytic converts to the exhaust of every new car.</p>

<p>This was nothing to Honda though. Why? Because the new CVCC engine that Civic was equipped with didn’t need one. And that’s because Honda, almost 10 years before this change was requested, decided not to trust those sketchy catalytic converter boxes. They were aiming for engines that run cleaner themselves rather than let all those additives pass through the engine and let a box before the exhaust engine do the dirty work. The Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion Engine (or CVCC for short) could run clean enough to pass emission tests without a cat. Honda was years ahead from their competitors and people started realizing that they don’t really need a huge gas guzzling sedan to cruise around the city, discovering the appeal of Civic and Honda. Maybe they could live something smaller that was hiding its true power underneath that hood...</p>

<p>The story will continue!...</p>
